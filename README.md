# WWT Logger
The logger module was created in order to log specific information. The template looks like this:
>**Example**: 
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR [Thu, 19 Nov 2020 19:14:58 GMT]: Something went wrong with the database connection

#### An example of using the logger: 
```
const path = require("path");
const Logger = require("wwt-logger)

const logger_instance = new Logger({ dir: path.join(__dirname, "logs") });
const {logType} = logger_instance
```
In order to add an entry to the log file, use the following code:
```
logger_instance.set(logeType.ERROR, `something text for log file`, (err) => { callback })
```
To get the file, just use the get method and we can use the built-in types: 
```
const {logType} = logger_instance
logger_instance.get(logType.ERROR, (err, data) => { callback })
```

**All logger types:**
```
enum LogTypes {
  ERROR = "ERROR",
  INFO = "INFO",
  WARNING = "WARNING",
  DEBUG = "DEBUG",
  FATAL = "FATAL"
}
```
